## What this is

Structured output means you tell the assistant, “Answer in this shape.” Not “vaguely similar,” but actually predictable.

Why you might care:

- you want to put answers into a spreadsheet
- you want an app to read the result without guessing
- you want the assistant to extract fields from messy text

<Callout kind="tip" title="Think: forms, not essays">
When you need reliability, ask for a form to be filled out. Essays are beautiful, but forms are dependable.

## The form-filling mindset

Instead of: “Summarize this contract.”

Try: “Extract these fields: parties, start date, end date, renewal terms, cancellation notice period.”

Then you can check each field and decide what to do next.

## Common mistakes

- **Too many fields at once**: start small; add fields only when you trust the pattern.
- **Ambiguous fields**: define what counts. Example: “start date = date service begins, not signature date.”
- **No validation**: add simple rules like “if unknown, return null, do not guess.”

Structured output pairs well with tool use. Example: extract an order ID, then call a tool to look it up. Keep a log of what fields were extracted and where they came from.
