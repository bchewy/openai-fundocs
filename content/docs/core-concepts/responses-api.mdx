## What this is

The Responses API is the “new control panel” for conversations that:

- have multiple steps
- may use tools
- may include images or audio
- need a clean record of what happened

If your project feels like a game of “keep track of every message forever,” this is the upgrade.

## Why it matters (non-technical version)

Imagine your assistant is doing a task, like:

1. read the customer question
2. search your docs
3. draft an answer
4. cite where the answer came from

The Responses API is the place where that whole mini-workflow lives.

<Callout kind="warn" title="Watch out: state and memory">
State is powerful. It also means you need to be intentional about retention, privacy, and what data is allowed to stick around.
</Callout>

If you are migrating from older APIs, focus on these ideas:

- treat each interaction as a “response” with a trace of events
- keep tool calls and tool outputs as first-class parts of the record
- decide what you store and for how long
