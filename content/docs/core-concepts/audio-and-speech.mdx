## What this is

Audio & speech is about building voice experiences:

- turn speech into text (transcription)
- turn text into speech (read-aloud)

## Where it shines

- call summaries
- voice notes
- accessibility features
- “talk to the app while your hands are busy”

<Callout kind="note" title="A human-friendly rule">
If the user can say it out loud, your UI should make it clear what will happen next.
</Callout>

## Safety and trust

- **Consent**: make it obvious when audio is being recorded or used.
- **Accuracy**: allow corrections; people will care about names and numbers.
- **Latency**: voice feels “broken” faster than text does. Keep feedback quick.

Voice agents are often an Agent + Tools combination. Make sure tool actions are obvious and approved when they matter.
