## Welcome to the Workshop

Think of the OpenAI platform like a workshop with a few key rooms. You do not need to know the names of every wrench to understand what is happening.

Here is the tour:

- **The Writing Desk**: ask for text. Rewrite things. Summarize. Explain.
- **The Form Filler**: ask for answers in a predictable shape (so computers can use them).
- **The Errand Runner**: let the model ask your software to do something, then keep going.
- **The Gallery Wall**: make images or understand images.
- **The Recording Booth**: work with speech (listen or speak).
- **The Workbench**: get help with code.
- **The New Control Panel**: run multi-step conversations in one place.

The model is great at *language*. Tools and guardrails are what make it good at *reality*.

## How to read these pages

Each page starts with:

- what you are trying to do
- what you might accidentally do
- what you can do to keep it safe

Then, if you are a builder, there is a small “builder notes” section you can expand.
