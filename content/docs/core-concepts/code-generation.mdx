## What this is

Code generation is pairing a developer with a calm, fast teammate.

It helps with:

- drafting boilerplate
- refactoring messy parts
- writing tests
- explaining code you did not write

<Callout kind="tip" title="Treat it like pair programming">
You still review. The assistant reduces grind and helps you see options faster.
</Callout>

## How to get better results

- give the goal, not just the file
- describe constraints (language, style, performance, security requirements)
- show an example of “good code” from your codebase

## Where teams get burned

- **Copy-paste without review**: risks bugs, security issues, or license problems.
- **Missing context**: the assistant cannot follow your internal conventions if it cannot see them.
- **No tests**: changes feel right until prod says otherwise.

If your agent can edit files (Apply patch) or run commands (Shell), keep it in a sandbox and require approvals for anything destructive.
