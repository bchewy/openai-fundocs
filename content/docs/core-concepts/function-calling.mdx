## What this is

Function calling is how an assistant stops being “just chat” and becomes “chat that can do things.”

In plain terms:

- you define a menu of actions your software can perform
- the model can pick an action and provide the inputs
- your system runs it, then tells the model what happened

<Callout kind="note" title="You are still in charge">
The model suggests an action. Your system decides whether it is allowed and actually runs it.
</Callout>

## Examples in everyday language

- “Look up the user’s latest invoice.”
- “Create a support ticket with this summary.”
- “Check today’s shipping status for order 18372.”

## Safety rules that actually work

- **Allowlist**: only expose actions you are comfortable with.
- **Ask-first mode**: require approval for expensive or irreversible actions.
- **Log everything**: who asked, what was attempted, what ran, what came back.
- **Fail safe**: if the tool fails, do not pretend it succeeded.

This pairs with the Tools section (Shell, Web search, File search, Computer use). Keep your tool schemas strict, and validate inputs before executing.
