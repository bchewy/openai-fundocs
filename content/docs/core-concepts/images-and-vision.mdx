## What this is

“Images and vision” covers two superpowers:

- **Making images**: you describe what you want, the model generates it.
- **Understanding images**: you show an image, the model explains what it sees.

## The trick: be specific

If you say “make it modern,” the assistant has to guess what “modern” means to you.

Instead:

- specify the subject
- specify the vibe
- specify the constraints (size, background, style boundaries)

<Callout kind="warn" title="Watch out: sensitive images">
Decide what kinds of images are allowed, where they can be stored, and who can view them. Treat image inputs like user data.
</Callout>

## Helpful patterns

- **Describe then refine**: generate a draft, then ask for focused changes (“make the lighting warmer”, “remove the text”).
- **Ask what you care about**: “Is there a stop sign in this photo?” is better than “Describe the image.”
- **Add a checklist**: “If you are unsure, say so.”

The Tools section has “Image generation” (tool) and “Computer use” (screenshot loops). For safety, add size limits, content filters, and storage rules.
