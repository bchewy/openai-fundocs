## What this is

Computer use is “remote hands.” The model proposes UI actions (click, type, scroll) and your system executes them and returns screenshots.

It is useful when:

- there is no API
- the fastest path is “use the website”

<Callout kind="warn" title="The guardrails matter more here">
UI automation can click the wrong thing. Use allowlists, sandboxes, and human approval for sensitive actions.
</Callout>

## A safe loop

1. model proposes an action
2. your system checks whether it is allowed
3. it executes and returns a screenshot
4. the model confirms what happened
