## Tools: meet your gear

Tools are how your assistant stops guessing and starts checking.

Without tools, the model can only do what you can do with words.
With tools, it can:

- look things up
- search your documents
- run calculations
- run commands
- make carefully structured file edits
- (with guardrails) click around a UI

<Callout kind="tip" title="Rule of thumb">
Start with the smallest tool set that works. Every tool is a new door to secure.

## Who chooses the tool?

You decide what tools are allowed. The model decides when to use them. Your system decides whether the model’s request is approved and safe to run.
