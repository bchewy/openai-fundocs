## What this is

Local shell is a legacy pattern for running commands on a local machine.

## Why it is “legacy”

It is harder to secure and audit local execution than a controlled sandbox. Most teams should use a modern shell tool setup with strict policies.

<Callout kind="warn" title="If you must do this">
Use a dedicated machine, strict allowlists, and log everything. Never run with access to secrets you cannot rotate.
