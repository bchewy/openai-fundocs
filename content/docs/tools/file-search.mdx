## What this is

File search is your librarian. It helps the model answer questions using your own documents and then point to where it found the answer.

## Great for

- internal policies
- product docs
- wikis and runbooks
- “what does our company do in situation X?”

<Callout kind="note" title="Receipts matter">
The best answers include “where this came from.” If you cannot cite it, treat it as advice, not truth.
</Callout>

## Safety basics

- separate “public docs” and “private docs”
- enforce permissions outside the model
- keep retention rules for uploaded files
