## What this is

Apply patch is the mechanic. Instead of “edit this file however,” it makes edits in a structured diff format.

Why that matters:

- you can review changes
- you can apply changes safely
- you can reject partial or risky edits

<Callout kind="tip" title="Prefer structured edits for production repos">
It is easier to audit a patch than a paragraph describing a patch.
</Callout>

## Guardrails that help

- require tests to pass after changes
- block edits to secrets and config folders by default
- cap the size of changes in one step
