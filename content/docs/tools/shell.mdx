## What this is

Shell is the workshop. It lets the assistant run real commands and read the output.

Good uses:

- run tests
- format code
- inspect files
- reproduce a bug

<Callout kind="warn" title="Shell access is powerful">
If you give shell access, you also give the ability to delete data, leak secrets, or run expensive workloads. Use sandboxes and approvals.
</Callout>

## Recommended guardrails

- run in a sandbox container
- block destructive commands by default
- limit network access when possible
- log commands and outputs
