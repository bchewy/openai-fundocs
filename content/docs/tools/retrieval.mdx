## What this is

Retrieval is how “search my docs” works under the hood. You do not need to be an ML person to use it, but you do need the right expectations.

## The simple version

- your documents get indexed
- a query comes in
- the system finds the most relevant chunks
- the model answers using those chunks

## What makes it feel good

- clean documents (titles, headings, not a single 400-page blob)
- good chunking (not too small, not too big)
- ranking that prefers the right kind of source (policy vs blog post)

<Callout kind="tip" title="Retrieval is not magic memory">
If a fact is not in your indexed content, retrieval cannot invent it. It can only find what you gave it.
