## What this is

Skills are reusable “recipe cards” that teach the assistant how your team works.

Instead of re-explaining:

- how to run tests
- where configs live
- what “done” means in your repo

…you give it a skill it can follow every time.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Skills reduce chaos">
They make results consistent across people, projects, and days. That is the real superpower.

## Good skill ingredients

- step-by-step workflow
- what to do when blocked
- safety rules (“do not run destructive commands”)
- expected output format
