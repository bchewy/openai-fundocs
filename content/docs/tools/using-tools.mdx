## What this is

This page explains the “tool loop” in plain language:

1. the model sees a question
2. it decides it needs a tool
3. it asks for a tool call with specific inputs
4. your system runs the tool (or blocks it)
5. the model uses the tool’s output to continue

## Three decisions you own

- **Which tools exist** (allowlist)
- **Which tool calls are approved** (gates)
- **What gets logged** (audit trail)

<Callout kind="warn" title="Tool output is part of the truth">
If a tool fails, returns nothing, or returns partial data, your agent should say so. “Pretend success” is how incidents happen.
</Callout>

Implement input validation. Treat tool call arguments as untrusted input. Add rate limits and timeouts.
