## What this is

Connectors and MCP servers are adapters. They let your assistant talk to other systems without you rewriting everything from scratch.

In human terms:

- **Connector**: a pre-made adapter
- **MCP server**: a “tool shelf” that exposes actions and data

<Callout kind="warn" title="Treat every connector like a new employee">
It needs permissions. It needs auditing. It needs a clear scope. Otherwise it will accidentally do something expensive or unsafe.
</Callout>

## Good defaults

- least privilege (read-only first)
- explicit approvals for “write” actions
- logs for every call, with sensitive data redaction
