## What this is

Web search is the “scout.” It goes out, looks up up-to-date information, and comes back with receipts.

## When to use it

- current events and recent changes
- product specs and pricing (today, not last year)
- policies and docs that change often

Show citations (links) when you can. If there are no sources, the answer should say it is an estimate.

## Safety basics

- restrict domains when possible
- avoid searching with sensitive personal data
- log queries for auditing
