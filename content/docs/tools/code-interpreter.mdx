## What this is

Code Interpreter is the lab bench. It lets the assistant run code (often Python) in a sandbox to:

- do math
- analyze a file
- create charts or reports

## When it is the right tool

- spreadsheets that need cleaning
- “what does this dataset say?”
- quick simulations

<Callout kind="warn" title="Sandbox does not mean “no rules”">
You still decide what files can be read or written, what can be downloaded, and what should be logged.
