## What this is

Agent Builder is for designing an agent without starting from a blank page.

You build something closer to a flowchart:

- what the agent is trying to do
- what information it can use
- what tools it is allowed to touch
- when it should ask a human

## A good first build

Start with a tiny agent:

- one job
- one data source
- one or two tools

Then test it with real user questions. Expand only after you have receipts.

If you add an action that can change customer data, you also add approvals and logging. That is not optional.

Even if you design in a UI, you still need to think like an engineer: permissions, auditing, and failure modes.
