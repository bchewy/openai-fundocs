## What this is

Voice agents are agents you talk to, like a phone call or a walkie-talkie:

- the user speaks
- the agent responds in voice
- tools still work in the background

## What makes voice different

- people notice delay more
- interruptions are normal
- mistakes feel more personal

<Callout kind="warn" title="Voice needs clearer consent">
Make it obvious when audio is being captured, stored, or sent for processing. Give users a stop button that actually stops.
</Callout>

## The best voice experiences

- say what you are doing (“Let me check that.”)
- confirm critical details (names, numbers, addresses)
- show a transcript for review

Voice agents often combine audio input/output with tool calls. Treat tool actions as visible steps in the conversation (even if the output is spoken).
