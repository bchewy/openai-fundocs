## What this is

The Agents SDK is for teams who want to run agents inside their own product:

- you host the app
- the agent uses the tools you provide
- you keep a trace of tool calls and outputs

## When you need it

- you want your agent to live in your workflow
- you want to integrate with your database and permissions
- you want reliable observability (traces, evals, grading)

<Callout kind="note" title="Design principle">
The model should be a decision-maker, not an execution engine. Put execution behind tools with validation.
</Callout>

At minimum, your agent runtime needs:

- a tool registry (what actions exist)
- an approval strategy (what requires human confirmation)
- a trace store (what happened)
- a retry story (what to do when tools fail)
