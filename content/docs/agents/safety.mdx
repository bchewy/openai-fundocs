## What this is

Safety in building agents means: the agent is useful without becoming reckless.

Your agent should never feel like a black box with your production systems attached.

## The three seatbelts

1. **Scope**: what the agent is allowed to do (and not do).
2. **Approval**: which actions require a human “yes.”
3. **Audit**: logs that let you answer: “what happened and why?”

<Callout kind="warn" title="If you can’t explain it, don’t automate it">
If a process is too complex to explain to a new teammate, it is too complex to hand to an agent without a lot of guardrails.
</Callout>

## Good defaults

- default to read-only tools
- default to small budgets (time, tokens, cost)
- default to “ask when unsure”
- default to storing traces with redaction

Model outputs are not permission checks. Treat approvals and allowlists as code, not text. Enforce them outside the model.
