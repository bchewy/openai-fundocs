## What this is

Custom theming makes the agent experience match your product.

## Non-technical checklist

- the agent name is consistent everywhere
- the tone matches your brand voice
- safety messages sound like your UI (not like a research paper)

<Callout kind="note" title="Trust is design">
People trust what feels familiar. If the agent is a new capability, the UI should feel like an old friend.
