## What this is

Advanced integration is when “just embed a chat UI” is not enough.

Examples:

- your agent must respect complex permissions
- your workflows require multiple systems (CRM + ticketing + internal wiki)
- you need a custom approval process

## The non-technical questions to answer first

- What data can the agent see?
- What actions can it take?
- What requires approval?
- What should be logged and who can view the logs?
- What happens when a tool fails?

This is where you’ll care about auth, audit logs, rate limits, and safe retries.
