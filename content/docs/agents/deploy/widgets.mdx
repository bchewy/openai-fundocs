## What this is

Widgets are the “small pieces” you can embed: a launcher button, a chat bubble, a help panel.

## Good uses

- add help without redesigning your whole app
- place the agent right where a question happens
- keep the interaction lightweight

<Callout kind="tip" title="Put the agent where decisions happen">
If you put it on a random page, it becomes a novelty. Put it next to real work.
</Callout>

  <summary>Builder notes (optional)</summary>

Widgets should expose the same safety UI: show when tools run, show citations, and require approvals when needed.
