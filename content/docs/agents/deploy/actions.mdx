## What this is

Actions are the “do something” buttons your agent can trigger.

Instead of the agent saying, “You could do X,” it can offer:

- “Create ticket”
- “Request approval”
- “Open the right dashboard”

<Callout kind="warn" title="Actions must be safe by design">
An action should be reversible or gated. If it can’t be reversed, it requires approval and logging.
</Callout>

## A good action has

- a clear name
- clear inputs
- clear success/failure messages
- a human visible trail

Actions are tools. Validate inputs, enforce permissions in code, and treat model output as untrusted.
