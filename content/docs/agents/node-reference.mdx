## What this is

Agents are usually built from “nodes.” A node is a step in the plan.

If you like metaphors:

- nodes are Lego pieces
- the agent is the Lego set
- tools are the special parts that can move in real life

## Common node types (in human terms)

- **Input**: what the user said, plus context you provide
- **Think**: the agent decides what to do next
- **Tool**: the agent asks your system to do a thing
- **Check**: verify it worked; handle errors
- **Output**: what you show to the user

<Callout kind="tip" title="Put a “check” node near anything expensive">
If it costs money, changes data, or triggers emails, add an explicit check and approval gate.

The exact node list depends on your agent framework, but the patterns are consistent: plan, act, observe, repeat. Always store a trace.
