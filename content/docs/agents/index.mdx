## What is an agent?

An agent is an assistant that does more than answer. It can:

- follow a plan
- use tools
- keep a trace of what happened
- stay inside rules you set

If a chatbot is a helpful conversation, an agent is a helpful coworker with a checklist.

<Callout kind="tip" title="The best agents are boring">
They have a narrow job, clear limits, and predictable behavior. “Do everything” agents become “break everything” agents.
</Callout>

## Make an agent brief first

Before you write code (or use a builder), write the one-page brief:

- role
- goal
- tone
- safety rules

<AgentBriefBuilder />

## What you will build next

- **Agent Builder**: design with blocks
- **Node reference**: learn the blocks
- **Safety**: add guardrails
- **Agents SDK**: run it in your app
